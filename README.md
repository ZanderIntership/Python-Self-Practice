🧠 LeetCode Problem Solutions (Python)
Overview

This repository contains my Python solutions to 70+ LeetCode problems, covering a wide range of algorithmic and data-structure concepts.
Each problem is implemented in its own file and named using the official LeetCode problem number and title for easy reference.

This repository serves as:

A personal learning log 📘

A reference for common problem-solving patterns

A portfolio of consistent problem-solving practice

📂 Repository Structure

Each solution follows this naming convention:

<problem_number>. <problem_title>.py


Example:

258. Add Digits.py
75. Sort Colors.py
4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays.py


This makes it easy to:

Search by problem number

Cross-reference directly with LeetCode

Track progress over time
